# Awesome Tryo

A curated list of books, libraries, apps and papers we love at [Tryolabs][tryo].

# Training

The training period at Tryolabs is at least two weeks. Its goal is to get up to
speed with the tools the company uses. This repo contains a list of tutorials
and documentation useful for becoming familiar with the Django/Python ecosystem.

During the training period, we recommend doing at least an hour a day of pairing
with a mentor who has experience in the team, to get to know the work process
and the tools. The goal is to get the mentor to coment on the tasks they are
doing to the person in training.
